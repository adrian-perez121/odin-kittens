## Initial Thoughts

APIs are something I was looking forward to learning about. It turns out I knew very little about
them based on the readings that I have done. Initially only looked at the side of using external APIs
but as it turns out I am creating an API in this project. This will be interesting...

## Final Thoughts

That went much faster than expected but I can tell that I have only scratched the surface when it comes to
creating an API. I was hoping to get it to work in Postman but I couldn't get it to work. That was
an interesting experience. I like having control over what the API returns. I like it especially since
(as of now) it is not that difficult to implement. However, we will see how things change overtime.

Alright...onto the next project
